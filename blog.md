### My OSCP Journey & VAPT Reports
</p>
Welcome to my blog, where I document my journey to becoming a certified penetration tester. This section features professional-grade Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) reports. Each report is a detailed account of a simulated engagement, from initial reconnaissance to exploitation and post-exploitation.

The goal of these reports is to showcase a methodical and thorough approach to security testing.
