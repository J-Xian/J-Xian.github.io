## About Me  
### The Story Behind My Cyber Playground

Greetings! I'm **J-Xian**, a cybersecurity enthusiast currently pursuing advanced certifications such as **CPTS** and **OSCP** while continuously sharpening my offensive security skills through labs, writeups, and real-world simulations.

This site — my *Cyber Playground* — serves as a transparent record of my learning journey in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and digital defense.  
I document not only successes but also the process: enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation insights gained from structured labs and platforms like **Hack The Box**, **TryHackMe**, and **MAGES Institute** coursework.

What drives me is the problem-solving nature of cybersecurity — the thrill of discovery, the precision of methodology, and the satisfaction of transforming vulnerabilities into understanding. 
### Current Learning Focus
I'm deepening my hands-on experience in offensive security through
controlled lab environments and certification paths like CPTS and OSCP.

My current areas of exploration include:
- Privilege Escalation and Post-Exploitation Techniques
- Web and Network Penetration Testing (VAPT)
- Container, Cloud, and Hybrid Infrastructure Security
- Methodical Vulnerability Research and Reporting
- Continuous Learning through Capture-the-Flag and Lab Practice

Beyond the technical side, I value clarity, ethics, and persistence — qualities I bring into every engagement and collaboration.

  “A penetration tester doesn’t walk the easy path — they forge it, one exploit, one failure, one victory at a time. Every broken barrier is proof that persistence is the sharpest tool you’ll ever wield.”
