## About Me  
### The Story Behind My Cyber Playground

Greetings! I'm **J-Xian**, a cybersecurity enthusiast currently pursuing advanced certifications such as **CPTS** and **OSCP** while continuously sharpening my offensive security skills through labs, writeups, and real-world simulations.

This site — my *Cyber Playground* — serves as a transparent record of my learning journey in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and digital defense.  
I document not only successes but also the process: enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation insights gained from structured labs and platforms like **Hack The Box**, **TryHackMe**, and **MAGES Institute** coursework.

What drives me is the problem-solving nature of cybersecurity — the thrill of discovery, the precision of methodology, and the satisfaction of transforming vulnerabilities into understanding. My focus areas include:

- Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)
- Post-exploitation & privilege escalation
- Network and web application security
- Container and cloud environment exploitation
- Continuous learning through certification paths (ISC2 CC, CEH, CPTS, OSCP)

Beyond the technical side, I value clarity, ethics, and persistence — qualities I bring into every engagement and collaboration.

If you're a fellow practitioner, recruiter, or enthusiast, I’d love to connect.  
You can explore my writeups on the [Home](/) page or reach out via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/j-xian-ching) for professional connections and discussions.
