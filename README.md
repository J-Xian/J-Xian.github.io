## 🧠 How I Built This

This portfolio was designed from scratch with a focus on clarity, creativity, and technical polish. I iteratively refined the layout, animations, and theme toggling to ensure smooth UX across devices. Every element — from the favicon to the scroll-triggered fade-ins — reflects my attention to detail and passion for visual storytelling.

I also used semantic HTML and modular CSS to keep the codebase clean and scalable. The site is deployed via GitHub Pages using Jekyll, allowing for easy updates and version control.

## 👤 About Me

I'm Jing Xian — a full-stack developer turned cybersecurity explorer. I approach both technical and interpersonal challenges with emotional intelligence, strategic reflection, and a touch of creative flair. This portfolio is more than a showcase; it's a space where curiosity meets code, and where I experiment with visual storytelling, subtle animations, and authentic branding.

Whether I'm decoding vulnerabilities or refining UX, I believe in thoughtful design, iterative growth, and building genuine connections — online and off.
